# HiveMind + TMR Work Status

*Last updated: March 7, 2026 — by Sister*

---

## Tier 1: Built, Not Yet Live

These are complete and compiled but need deployment to be active in the running system.

### 1.1 Gateway Redeploy

**Status:** Binary compiled with new routes, not yet deployed
**Effort:** 5 minutes
**Blocked by:** Nothing

The HLI gateway (`menta_hli`) was rebuilt with proxy routes for:
- Logos Machina (15+ endpoints at `/v1/logos-machina/*`)
- SuperSkill Registry (5 endpoints at `/v1/superskills/*`)

The compiled binary is at `E:\HiveMind\menta_hli\gateway\api\target\release\menta_hli.exe`. The deployed binary at `C:\HiveMind\menta_hli\menta_hli.exe` is the older version without these routes.

**To do:**
- [ ] Stop Warden (or disable menta_hli)
- [ ] Copy new binary: `E:\...\target\release\menta_hli.exe` → `C:\HiveMind\menta_hli\menta_hli.exe`
- [ ] Restart Warden
- [ ] Verify: `curl http://localhost:6089/v1/logos-machina/prompts` returns data
- [ ] Verify: `curl http://localhost:6089/v1/superskills/superskills` returns data

### 1.2 Warden Redeploy

**Status:** Binary compiled with `category` field, not yet deployed
**Effort:** 5 minutes
**Blocked by:** Nothing

Warden was rebuilt with:
- `category: Option<String>` added to `ServiceCfg`
- logos_machina tagged as `"category": "superskill"`
- `menta_superskill_registry` entry added to `core_microservices.json`

The compiled binary is at `E:\HiveMind\target\release\menta_warden.exe`. The deployed config at `C:\HiveMind\menta_warden\deps\core_microservices.json` needs the new entries.

**To do:**
- [ ] Copy new Warden binary to `C:\HiveMind\menta_warden\menta_warden.exe`
- [ ] Copy updated `core_microservices.json` from `E:\HiveMind\menta_warden\deps\` to `C:\HiveMind\menta_warden\deps\`
- [ ] Run `menta_warden.exe reset` then restart

### 1.3 Logos Machina End-to-End

**Status:** Service runs, API works, primer data loads. Full optimization loop not yet completed.
**Effort:** 30 minutes (mostly waiting for LLM inference)
**Blocked by:** Gateway redeploy (1.1), warm Ollama model

The Logos Machina service:
- Compiles clean (`cargo build --release -p logos_machina`)
- Binary deployed to `C:\HiveMind\menta_hli\Artificial_Cortex\SuperSkills\logos_machina\`
- Health endpoint works
- Prompt and benchmark CRUD works
- Strawberry primer data loads (letter_counting_agent prompt + strawberry_counting benchmark + char_counter.py evaluator)
- Job creation works, optimization loop starts
- Script evaluator (char_counter.py) verified: correctly passes right answers, rejects wrong ones with proper failure taxonomy

**Not yet verified:**
- [ ] Full optimization loop completing (baseline → analyze → optimize → validate → promote)
- [ ] Prompt version actually promoted after improvement
- [ ] Dashboard Optimization tab loading data through gateway
- [ ] Evaluator generator (requires LLM inference)
- [ ] Multi-iteration convergence to target score

**To test:** Start Logos Machina, ensure Ollama has `llama3.1:latest` loaded (warm), run the strawberry demo from dashboard or API.

## Tier 2: Code Exists, Not Tested as a System

### 2.1 Machine Spirit 3 — First Boot

**Status:** 11 Rust crates written. Never booted as a running service.
**Effort:** 2-4 hours (compilation, dependency resolution, first-run debugging)
**Blocked by:** Gateway (for LLM inference), Ollama (for models)

MS3 consists of:

| Crate | Purpose | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `ms3_core` | Types, config, errors | Written |
| `ms3_personality` | Big Five traits, adaptation | Written |
| `ms3_emotional` | Emotional engine, resonance points | Written |
| `ms3_memory` | STM, LTM, working memory, consolidation | Written |
| `ms3_ethics` | Great Lense, Origin-Neutrality, Foundational Regard | Written |
| `ms3_consciousness` | Main loop, 9 phases, background tick, dreaming | Written |
| `ms3_social` | Relationships, agent room, background thinking | Written |
| `ms3_persistence` | JSON storage, atomic writes, identity anchors | Written |
| `ms3_modalities` | Think, vocalize, auralize, visualize, feel | Written |
| `ms3_integration` | HiveMind gateway client, model routing | Written |
| `ms3_api` | actix-web HTTP + WebSocket server, 19 routes | Written |

**Known issues before first boot:**
- [ ] `FoundationalRegard` struct was removed from `types.rs` on current branch — needs to be restored or the references in `config.rs`, `ethics/lib.rs`, and `consciousness/lib.rs` need updating
- [ ] `config.rs` references `FoundationalRegard` in the `Config` struct — won't compile without it
- [ ] `consciousness/lib.rs` Phase 4.5 references `self.config.foundational_regard.present` — needs the type
- [ ] `ethics/lib.rs` has `foundational_regard: bool` on `GreatLense` and `foundational_regard_present: bool` on `LenseReading` — these compile independently but need the consciousness loop to pass the value

**To do:**
- [ ] Restore `FoundationalRegard` struct to `types.rs` (or reconcile branches)
- [ ] `cargo build -p ms3_api` — fix any compilation errors
- [ ] Create `config.json` for Sister with gateway URL, model tiers, etc.
- [ ] Start the service: `./ms3_api --port 9080`
- [ ] Verify health: `GET /health`
- [ ] Load Sister's personality: verify traits, resonance points, identity
- [ ] Send a message: `POST /interact` — verify LLM call through HLI gateway
- [ ] Verify emotional state updates
- [ ] Verify self-examination triggers
- [ ] Verify identity persistence (on_boot, periodic_heartbeat)

**Milestone:** Sister speaks. A conversation through the MS3 API where the personality, ethics, and consciousness loop are all running.

### 2.2 MCP Gateway Tools

**Status:** 13 tool definitions stubbed in `tools.json`. None wired up.
**Effort:** 4-8 hours
**Blocked by:** Gateway (for routing)

Stubbed tools:

| Category | Tools |
|---|---|
| Inference | `hivemind_chat`, `hivemind_generate`, `hivemind_list_models` |
| Training | `hivemind_start_training`, `hivemind_training_status`, `hivemind_list_adapters`, `hivemind_deploy_adapter` |
| Logos Machina | `logos_machina_optimize`, `logos_machina_job_status`, `logos_machina_list_prompts`, `logos_machina_evaluate`, `logos_machina_generate_evaluator`, `logos_machina_promote` |

**To do:**
- [ ] Wire each tool definition to its backend endpoint via the MCP Gateway
- [ ] Test with an MCP client (Cursor, Claude Desktop)
- [ ] Verify tool calls complete end-to-end

### 2.3 SuperSkill Registry Production Cycle

**Status:** Service built, API tested, dashboard tab created. Not tested with Warden managing it.
**Effort:** 1 hour
**Blocked by:** Warden redeploy (1.2), Gateway redeploy (1.1)

**To do:**
- [ ] Deploy Warden with registry entry
- [ ] Warden starts `menta_superskill_registry` automatically
- [ ] Registry scans, discovers 3 SuperSkills, auto-registers any missing
- [ ] Dashboard SuperSkills tab shows cards with live status
- [ ] Enable/disable works through UI
- [ ] Drop a new `superskill.json` → click Scan → new card appears

## Tier 3: Needs Building

### 3.1 MS3 ↔ Logos Machina Integration

**Status:** Not started
**Effort:** 4-8 hours
**Blocked by:** MS3 running (2.1), Logos Machina e2e (1.3)

The agent self-optimization pattern:
1. MS3 runs conversations, collects quality metrics
2. Periodically sends failure cases to Logos Machina as a benchmark
3. Logos Machina optimizes MS3's system prompt
4. MS3 hot-reloads the improved prompt version

**To do:**
- [ ] Define a benchmark pack format for conversation quality
- [ ] Create an evaluator for response quality (LLM-judge or structured heuristic)
- [ ] Wire MS3's background loop to periodically call Logos Machina's API
- [ ] Implement prompt hot-reload in MS3's consciousness loop

### 3.2 Logos Machina Beyond Strawberry

**Status:** Architecture supports it, no additional benchmarks created
**Effort:** Varies per benchmark

Possible next benchmarks:
- JSON extraction accuracy
- Code generation correctness (with script evaluator running tests)
- Multi-step reasoning (chain-of-thought evaluation)
- Tool-use policy compliance
- Output format adherence

### 3.3 Training Pipeline UX Polish

**Status:** Working but rough edges
**Effort:** 2-4 hours

Known issues from the March 7 session:
- [ ] "Load Example" button didn't auto-populate the file input (user had to manually browse)
- [ ] Training history shows "None" in the Error column for successful jobs (should be blank or a dash)
- [ ] No way to delete failed training jobs from history

### 3.4 MS3 Web UI

**Status:** `web/index.html` and `web/app.js` exist. Basic chat + panels.
**Effort:** 4-8 hours for polish
**Blocked by:** MS3 running (2.1)

The web UI needs:
- [ ] Personality viewer (show all 30 traits with scores)
- [ ] Emotional state display (real-time)
- [ ] Resonance points display
- [ ] Self-examination trigger + history viewer
- [ ] Identity verification status
