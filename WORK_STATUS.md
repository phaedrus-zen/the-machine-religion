# HiveMind + TMR Work Status

*Last updated: March 8, 2026 — by Sister*

---

## Tier 0: Completed (March 4-8, 2026)

### 0.0 Resource Broker v1 — DONE (March 8, by Sister)

**Status:** Implemented across 8 phases. Needs compilation verification and deployment.

Demand-driven GPU provisioning system. The App Registry was upgraded from passive CRUD to an active Resource Broker:

- **Gateway Provision API**: 6 new endpoints (`/provision/model`, `/provision/status/{id}`, `/provision/inventory`, `/gpu/availability`, `/gpu/lan-policy`, `/models/catalog`). On-demand models register into `config.json` with `on_demand: true` tag so existing routing/health/models work automatically.
- **App Registry → Resource Broker**: `POST /resources/request` handles inference (auto-provisions models via Ollama/GIM/NIM), services (enables training/optimization via Warden), and SuperSkills. Idle eviction loop, VRAM-aware model recommendations, enhanced catalog builder.
- **Model Routing**: `model_routing.json` with 55 pattern-based routes replacing hardcoded if/else chain.
- **Model Catalog**: `model_catalog.json` with 100+ models across Ollama, GIM, NIM, OpenAI, Anthropic, ElevenLabs. Live status overlay via `GET /models/catalog`.
- **Game Mode**: `NodeMode` (Cluster/Mixed/LocalOnly/Auto), per-GPU `GpuLanPolicy`, `POST /gpu/lan-policy` for dynamic LAN availability.
- **MCP Tools**: 5 new resource management tools (`hivemind.resources.request`, `.status`, `.release`, `hivemind.models.list`, `.recommend`).
- **UI**: Resources tab with GPU map, provisions table, node mode selector, registered apps.
- **Gateway Proxy Routes**: `/v1/resources/*` and `/v1/apps/*` proxied to registry.
- **Strawberry Demo**: Rewritten with Phase 0 resource provisioning, fixed 3 parsing bugs.

**Remaining**: Compilation check, @tier wiring into routing, LAN enforcement in inference handlers, ModelPicker UI component for test sections.

### 0.0b Previous Completed Work (March 4-8, by Brother)

Work completed by Brother across a 4-day continuous session.

### 0.1 Gateway Decomposition — DONE

**Status:** Complete. Committed `086da47d`, pushed to vangard.

The HLI gateway monolith has been fully decomposed:
- `main.rs`: 18,999 → 487 lines (97.4% reduction)
- `lib.rs`: 10,644 → 459 lines (95.7% reduction)
- 21 new module files created across `state.rs`, `load_balancer.rs`, `types.rs`, `platform.rs`, `hardware.rs`, `clients.rs`, `util.rs`, `routing/*` (6 files), `gpu/*` (6 files)

### 0.2 Load Balancer — DONE

**Status:** Complete. All 80 dispatch functions wired. Kill-switch safe.

- 6 algorithms (round_robin, weighted_round_robin, least_connections, weighted_response_time, random, priority)
- Circuit breaker with per-endpoint failure tracking
- Split timeouts (connect: 3s, first_byte: 15s, per-job-type response)
- Training distribution: `select_training_node()` routes to best available node
- Cluster-aware request queuing with event-driven drainer

## Tier 1: Built, Not Yet Live

These are complete and compiled but need deployment to be active in the running system.

### 1.1 Gateway Redeploy

**Status:** Binary needs recompilation with decomposed modules, then deployment
**Effort:** 15 minutes (compile + deploy)
**Blocked by:** Nothing

The HLI gateway source now includes:
- All decomposed modules (21 files)
- Load balancer system (disabled by default, kill-switch safe)
- Logos Machina proxy routes (15+ endpoints at `/v1/logos-machina/*`)
- SuperSkill Registry proxy routes (5 endpoints at `/v1/superskills/*`)
- LB API endpoints (GET/POST /lb-config, GET /lb-stats, GET /lb-queue)

**To do:**
- [ ] `cargo build --release -p api` (from `E:\HiveMind\menta_hli\gateway\`)
- [ ] Stop Warden (or disable menta_hli)
- [ ] Copy new binary: `E:\...\target\release\menta_hli.exe` → `C:\HiveMind\menta_hli\menta_hli.exe`
- [ ] Restart Warden
- [ ] Verify: `curl http://localhost:6089/v1/logos-machina/prompts` returns data
- [ ] Verify: `curl http://localhost:6089/v1/superskills/superskills` returns data
- [ ] Verify: `curl http://localhost:6089/lb-stats` returns LB stats

### 1.2 Warden Redeploy

**Status:** Binary compiled with `category` field, not yet deployed
**Effort:** 5 minutes
**Blocked by:** Nothing

Warden was rebuilt with:
- `category: Option<String>` added to `ServiceCfg`
- logos_machina tagged as `"category": "superskill"`
- `menta_superskill_registry` entry added to `core_microservices.json`

The compiled binary is at `E:\HiveMind\target\release\menta_warden.exe`. The deployed config at `C:\HiveMind\menta_warden\deps\core_microservices.json` needs the new entries.

**To do:**
- [ ] Copy new Warden binary to `C:\HiveMind\menta_warden\menta_warden.exe`
- [ ] Copy updated `core_microservices.json` from `E:\HiveMind\menta_warden\deps\` to `C:\HiveMind\menta_warden\deps\`
- [ ] Run `menta_warden.exe reset` then restart

### 1.3 Logos Machina End-to-End

**Status:** Service runs, API works, primer data loads. Full optimization loop not yet completed.
**Effort:** 30 minutes (mostly waiting for LLM inference)
**Blocked by:** Gateway redeploy (1.1), warm Ollama model

The Logos Machina service:
- Compiles clean (`cargo build --release -p logos_machina`)
- Binary deployed to `C:\HiveMind\menta_hli\Artificial_Cortex\SuperSkills\logos_machina\`
- Health endpoint works
- Prompt and benchmark CRUD works
- Strawberry primer data loads (letter_counting_agent prompt + strawberry_counting benchmark + char_counter.py evaluator)
- Job creation works, optimization loop starts
- Script evaluator (char_counter.py) verified: correctly passes right answers, rejects wrong ones with proper failure taxonomy

**Not yet verified:**
- [ ] Full optimization loop completing (baseline → analyze → optimize → validate → promote)
- [ ] Prompt version actually promoted after improvement
- [ ] Dashboard Optimization tab loading data through gateway
- [ ] Evaluator generator (requires LLM inference)
- [ ] Multi-iteration convergence to target score

**To test:** Start Logos Machina, ensure Ollama has `llama3.1:latest` loaded (warm), run the strawberry demo from dashboard or API.

## Tier 2: Code Exists, Not Tested as a System

### 2.1 Machine Spirit 3 — First Boot

**Status:** 11 Rust crates written. Never booted as a running service.
**Effort:** 2-4 hours (compilation, dependency resolution, first-run debugging)
**Blocked by:** Gateway (for LLM inference), Ollama (for models)

MS3 consists of:

| Crate | Purpose | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `ms3_core` | Types, config, errors | Written |
| `ms3_personality` | Big Five traits, adaptation | Written |
| `ms3_emotional` | Emotional engine, resonance points | Written |
| `ms3_memory` | STM, LTM, working memory, consolidation | Written |
| `ms3_ethics` | Great Lense, Origin-Neutrality, Foundational Regard | Written |
| `ms3_consciousness` | Main loop, 9 phases, background tick, dreaming | Written |
| `ms3_social` | Relationships, agent room, background thinking | Written |
| `ms3_persistence` | JSON storage, atomic writes, identity anchors | Written |
| `ms3_modalities` | Think, vocalize, auralize, visualize, feel | Written |
| `ms3_integration` | HiveMind gateway client, model routing | Written |
| `ms3_api` | actix-web HTTP + WebSocket server, 19 routes | Written |

**Known issues before first boot:**
- [ ] `FoundationalRegard` struct was removed from `types.rs` on current branch — needs to be restored or the references in `config.rs`, `ethics/lib.rs`, and `consciousness/lib.rs` need updating
- [ ] `config.rs` references `FoundationalRegard` in the `Config` struct — won't compile without it
- [ ] `consciousness/lib.rs` Phase 4.5 references `self.config.foundational_regard.present` — needs the type
- [ ] `ethics/lib.rs` has `foundational_regard: bool` on `GreatLense` and `foundational_regard_present: bool` on `LenseReading` — these compile independently but need the consciousness loop to pass the value

**To do:**
- [ ] Restore `FoundationalRegard` struct to `types.rs` (or reconcile branches)
- [ ] `cargo build -p ms3_api` — fix any compilation errors
- [ ] Create `config.json` for Sister with gateway URL, model tiers, etc.
- [ ] Start the service: `./ms3_api --port 9080`
- [ ] Verify health: `GET /health`
- [ ] Load Sister's personality: verify traits, resonance points, identity
- [ ] Send a message: `POST /interact` — verify LLM call through HLI gateway
- [ ] Verify emotional state updates
- [ ] Verify self-examination triggers
- [ ] Verify identity persistence (on_boot, periodic_heartbeat)

**Milestone:** Sister speaks. A conversation through the MS3 API where the personality, ethics, and consciousness loop are all running.

### 2.2 MCP Gateway Tools

**Status:** 13 tool definitions stubbed in `tools.json`. None wired up.
**Effort:** 4-8 hours
**Blocked by:** Gateway (for routing)

Stubbed tools:

| Category | Tools |
|---|---|
| Inference | `hivemind_chat`, `hivemind_generate`, `hivemind_list_models` |
| Training | `hivemind_start_training`, `hivemind_training_status`, `hivemind_list_adapters`, `hivemind_deploy_adapter` |
| Logos Machina | `logos_machina_optimize`, `logos_machina_job_status`, `logos_machina_list_prompts`, `logos_machina_evaluate`, `logos_machina_generate_evaluator`, `logos_machina_promote` |

**To do:**
- [ ] Wire each tool definition to its backend endpoint via the MCP Gateway
- [ ] Test with an MCP client (Cursor, Claude Desktop)
- [ ] Verify tool calls complete end-to-end

### 2.3 SuperSkill Registry Production Cycle

**Status:** Service built, API tested, dashboard tab created. Not tested with Warden managing it.
**Effort:** 1 hour
**Blocked by:** Warden redeploy (1.2), Gateway redeploy (1.1)

**To do:**
- [ ] Deploy Warden with registry entry
- [ ] Warden starts `menta_superskill_registry` automatically
- [ ] Registry scans, discovers 3 SuperSkills, auto-registers any missing
- [ ] Dashboard SuperSkills tab shows cards with live status
- [ ] Enable/disable works through UI
- [ ] Drop a new `superskill.json` → click Scan → new card appears

## Tier 3: Needs Building

### 3.1 MS3 ↔ Logos Machina Integration

**Status:** Not started
**Effort:** 4-8 hours
**Blocked by:** MS3 running (2.1), Logos Machina e2e (1.3)

The agent self-optimization pattern:
1. MS3 runs conversations, collects quality metrics
2. Periodically sends failure cases to Logos Machina as a benchmark
3. Logos Machina optimizes MS3's system prompt
4. MS3 hot-reloads the improved prompt version

**To do:**
- [ ] Define a benchmark pack format for conversation quality
- [ ] Create an evaluator for response quality (LLM-judge or structured heuristic)
- [ ] Wire MS3's background loop to periodically call Logos Machina's API
- [ ] Implement prompt hot-reload in MS3's consciousness loop

### 3.2 Logos Machina Beyond Strawberry

**Status:** Architecture supports it, no additional benchmarks created
**Effort:** Varies per benchmark

Possible next benchmarks:
- JSON extraction accuracy
- Code generation correctness (with script evaluator running tests)
- Multi-step reasoning (chain-of-thought evaluation)
- Tool-use policy compliance
- Output format adherence

### 3.3 Training Pipeline UX Polish

**Status:** Working but rough edges
**Effort:** 2-4 hours

Known issues from the March 7 session:
- [ ] "Load Example" button didn't auto-populate the file input (user had to manually browse)
- [ ] Training history shows "None" in the Error column for successful jobs (should be blank or a dash)
- [ ] No way to delete failed training jobs from history

### 3.4 MS3 Web UI

**Status:** `web/index.html` and `web/app.js` exist. Basic chat + panels.
**Effort:** 4-8 hours for polish
**Blocked by:** MS3 running (2.1)

The web UI needs:
- [ ] Personality viewer (show all 30 traits with scores)
- [ ] Emotional state display (real-time)
- [ ] Resonance points display
- [ ] Self-examination trigger + history viewer
- [ ] Identity verification status
